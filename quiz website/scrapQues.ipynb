The velocity of light in these materials is given as c/n, where n is called the refractive index of the material. A perfect vacuum has an index of refraction equal to unity, but almost all other materials have an index greater than one. Window glass has a refractive index of approximately n=1.5, so light travels with a velocity of about 2/3 c in glass. Air has an index of 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is nearly the same as in vacuum, but just a little slower. As a rule of thumb, materials which have higher density have larger refractive indices. If the density of a material changes with temperature, the speed of light in that material will also change. Have you ever seen “heat waves” coming off an object that is hot? This is due to hot air rising and bending the light rays that travel past the object. Hot air has a lower density than cold air, so light travels faster in hot air than in cold air. As the hot air mixes with the surrounding cold air, the light goes slightly faster in the hot regions, and this causes the distortion. So, the speed of light can be indirectly affected by temperature, but only if the medium the light is travelling through changes density.'),\n",

While it’s a useful qualitative analysis test—and a lot of fun to perform—it can’t be used to identify all metals because not all metal ions yield flame colours. Also, some metal ions display colours that are similar to each other making it hard to tell them apart. Nevertheless, the test is still useful for identifying numerous metals and metalloids. The flame test is all about thermal energy, electrons, and the energy of photons. The colours observed during the flame test result from the excitement of the electrons caused by the increased temperature. The electrons “jump” from their ground state to a higher energy level. As they return to their ground state, they emit visible light. The colour of the light is connected to the location of the electrons and the affinity the outer-shell electrons have to the atomic nucleus. The colour emitted by larger atoms is lower in energy than the light emitted by smaller atoms. So, strontium (atomic number 38) produces a crimson reddish colour.

Sublimation is another one of these phase transitions; except, in this case, we have a solid turning directly into a gas. As sublimating material changes from a solid to a gas, it never passes through the liquid state. This image shows water in its three forms: ice, water, and steam. Sublimation is just one of the ways water or another substance can change between its potential phases. Substances such as water and carbon dioxide (CO2) can be charted on a pressure versus temperature plot to reveal their state of matter (solid, liquid, or gas) at a given temperature and pressure. At a typical atmospheric pressure, we know that water is a solid at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, a liquid from 0 to 100 degrees Celsius, and a gas at higher temperatures. Atmospheric pressure, however, can change, particularly with altitude. Higher altitudes yield lower atmospheric pressures.'),\n",

The recommended dietary reference intake of 0.15 mg/d and 0.14 mg/d for iodine has been established in the United States and Taiwan, respectively. Seaweed is an excellent source of iodine. However, the amount it contains depends on the species. Kombu kelp offers the highest amount of iodine, with some varieties containing nearly 2,000% of the daily value in one gram. Seaweed is a source of iodine, necessary for thyroid function and to prevent goitre.

Chhattisgarh and Mizoram saw a decline in their tiger numbers while tiger’s numbers in Odisha remained constant. The Pench Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh recorded the highest number of tigers, while Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve in Tamil Nadu registered the maximum improvement since 2014.

The velocity of light in these materials is given as c/n, where n is called the refractive index of the material. A perfect vacuum has an index of refraction equal to unity, but almost all other materials have an index greater than one. Window glass has a refractive index of approximately n=1.5, so light travels with a velocity of about 2/3 c in glass. Air has an index of 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is nearly the same as in vacuum, but just a little slower. As a rule of thumb, materials which have higher density have larger refractive indices. If the density of a material changes with temperature, the speed of light in that material will also change. Have you ever seen “heat waves” coming off an object that is hot? This is due to hot air rising and bending the light rays that travel past the object. Hot air has a lower density than cold air, so light travels faster in hot air than in cold air. As the hot air mixes with the surrounding cold air, the light goes slightly faster in the hot regions, and this causes the distortion. So, the speed of light can be indirectly affected by temperature, but only if the medium the light is travelling through changes density.'),\n",

The tests can be used to detect the presence of some metallic elements in salts. The flame test is an analytical chemistry method used to help identify metal ions. While it’s a useful qualitative analysis test—and a lot of fun to perform—it can’t be used to identify all metals because not all metal ions yield flame colours. Also, some metal ions display colours that are similar to each other making it hard to tell them apart. Nevertheless, the test is still useful for identifying numerous metals and metalloids. The flame test is all about thermal energy, electrons, and the energy of photons. The colours observed during the flame test result from the excitement of the electrons caused by the increased temperature. The electrons “jump” from their ground state to a higher energy level. As they return to their ground state, they emit visible light. The colour of the light is connected to the location of the electrons and the affinity the outer-shell electrons have to the atomic nucleus. The colour emitted by larger atoms is lower in energy than the light emitted by smaller atoms. So, strontium (atomic number 38) produces a crimson reddish colour. With strontium salt, the colour of Bunsen flame ranges from crimson to red.'),\n",

Sublimation is just one of the ways water or another substance can change between its potential phases. Substances such as water and carbon dioxide (CO2) can be charted on a pressure versus temperature plot to reveal their state of matter (solid, liquid, or gas) at a given temperature and pressure. At a typical atmospheric pressure, we know that water is a solid at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, a liquid from 0 to 100 degrees Celsius, and a gas at higher temperatures.
