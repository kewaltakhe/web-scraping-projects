Web scraping is the process of collecting data that are displayed in a website. We parse the HTML tree of the webpages and retrieve the data. The process includes
- identifying the target web element
- interacting with the element
- collecting the information

Libraries such as python BeautifulSoup and selenium can be used to automate browser and parse the HTML effectively.

The data collected can be stored in database, json, CSV etc. We can apply data processing and data analysis on the collected data.
